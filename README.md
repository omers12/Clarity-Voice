# Clarity‑Voice 🎙️  
**Final Project – B.Sc. Software Engineering Degree**

Clarity‑Voice is a user-friendly speech monitoring app designed to assist hearing‑impaired individuals in controlling and visualizing their speaking volume during conversations, lectures, or Zoom meetings. It captures microphone input, converts speech to text in real-time (using a model like OpenAI Whisper), and provides feedback to maintain clear and consistent speech.
