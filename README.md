# Clarity‑Voice 🎙️  
**Final Project – B.Sc. Software Engineering Degree**

Clarity‑Voice is a user-friendly speech monitoring app designed to assist hearing‑impaired individuals in controlling and visualizing their speaking volume during conversations, lectures, or Zoom meetings. It captures microphone input, converts speech to text in real-time (using a model like OpenAI Whisper), and provides feedback to maintain clear and consistent speech.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Real‑time microphone input** – continuously listens to spoken voice.  
- **Speech‑to‑text conversion** – transcribes speech using an AI model.  
- **Immediate feedback** – shows real-time visual/audible cues for voice volume.  
- **Volume control assistance** – helps maintain optimal speaking level.  
- **Supports diverse settings** – works during in-person chats, lectures, and virtual meetings.  
- **Permission management** – handles `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions on Android, macOS, or Windows.
